## 🚀 AveHR January 24th Release Update

Hello AveHR users! We’re excited to announce a new set of features and important fixes to enhance your platform experience. Here’s what’s included in this release:

### 🍿 New Features & Enhancements

- **Job Contracts Ordered by Year (RLN):** Job contracts are now automatically sorted from newest to oldest based on the year they were created, providing better visibility of recent contracts.
- **Holiday Preselection for Departments (RLN):** When creating a new department, all holidays can now be preselected, simplifying the setup process.
- **Cancel Leave Validation:** Users will no longer be able to cancel a leave request if the leave date is greater than the date requested, improving leave management accuracy.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fixed the **CORS error** when accessing www.avehr.com.
- Resolved the issue where **inactive users could still log in** to the platform.
- Fixed a bug where **new leave entitlements were not automatically activated** when created.
- Corrected the issue where the **My Leaves tab** was not displaying properly.

### 🗑️ Removed

- The **asterisk sign** has been removed from the ID field to simplify data entry.
